As a developer, you’re on the front lines to deliver business insights. Your organization depends on you not just to develop today’s applications—but to find the path to the next generation of solutions. 



HPE has the solution…..and an invitation for early access. 



HPE has taken the power of HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric and made it available as a fully managed service. This means you have access to hybrid data from edge, multicloud and data centers in one backbone of data that sits on HPE managed infrastructure. The result is a reduction in the amount of time you spend negotiating access rights from owners of data silos then relying on complex ETL (extract, transform, and load) processes to move the data to your systems.



Don’t worry, you won’t have to learn new tools or processes because HPE GreenLake for Data Fabric supports a wide range of industry standard APIs which means you can continue to use your existing tools. 



Develop in the cloud while data and models are automatically replicated to production environments such as edge, on-premises, or cloud environments. Layer on an ecosystem of the most popular open source tools to process data right where its created while the resulting insights are replicated back to your environment of choice.
