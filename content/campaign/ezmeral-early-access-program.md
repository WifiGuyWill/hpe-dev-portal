In the very near future, analytics from edge to cloud will be standard for all successful enterprises. The HPE Ezmeral portfolio of software products provides enterprises with the foundation they need to develop analytic applications across hybrid-cloud environments. HPE Ezmeral lets you seamlessly access, manage and govern all your data, regardless of where it is located, and combine it into a single view. Combined with our open-source analytics framework that allows your developers to use the tools of their choice, high-performance analytics can be delivered at enterprise scale with an overall lower TCO.

In addition to the existing portfolio of products, HPE is constantly researching and developing new capabilities, features, and products. So that application developers can try these new capabilities and features, we’ve developed the HPE Ezmeral Early Access (EEA) program that lets developers try the new products before they’re released. With exemplary training and support provided by HPE, developers will get real-time, hands-on experience with new products, features and capabilities to solve advanced data and analytics problems. A key element of the EEA program is the feedback we’ll collect from developers, providing input to the product roadmap and helping ensure it continues to evolve with our customers’ needs.
